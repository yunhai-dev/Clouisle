# Chatting with AI Agents

This guide explains how to interact with AI agents in Clouisle for conversational AI experiences.

## Overview

AI Agents in Clouisle are conversational assistants that can:
- Answer questions based on knowledge bases (RAG)
- Use tools to perform actions
- Maintain context across multiple turns
- Stream responses in real-time

## Starting a Conversation

### From the Apps page

1. Navigate to **Apps** (`/app/apps`).
2. Open the **Agent** tab and find the agent you want to use.
3. Open the agent card menu and choose **Chat**.
4. The agent chat opens at `/chat/{agent_id}`. Send your first message.

There is no global Chat/Conversations page or global **New Chat** picker. Each agent's chat page contains that agent's recent conversations.

### From an existing agent chat

1. Open the agent's chat page.
2. Use the conversation controls in that page to continue a recent conversation or start a new one.
3. Type your message and send it.

#### 1. Chain of Thought (CoT) & Dynamic Tool Perception

The reasoning header dynamically reflects the model's high-level execution state in real time:
- **Pure Reasoning**: While the model streams reasoning tokens with no active tools, the header displays an animated shimmer with `思考中...` (`Thinking...`).
- **Single Active Tool**: The header semantically classifies the active tool call and displays intuitive action phrases (e.g., `正在读取文件...`, `正在运行代码...`, `正在查询：{name}...`, `正在请求接口：{endpoint}...`).
- **Parallel Tool Execution**: When multiple tools execute concurrently, the header aggregates them as `正在并行调用 {count} 个工具...` (`Calling {count} tools in parallel...`).
- **Completed State**: Once the agent finishes generating, the header shows the total reasoning duration (e.g., `思考了 4 秒` / `Thought for 4s`) and can be collapsed or expanded at any time.

#### 2. Interactive Human-in-the-Loop (`AskUserForm`)

When an agent needs human input or clarification before proceeding, it invokes the built-in `ask_user` tool:
- **Composer-Level Form**: The interactive question form appears directly above the input box (rather than being buried in the message stream).
- **Flexible Answers**:
  - **Option Chips**: Click predefined suggestion chips.
  - **Custom Text**: Type a custom text response beneath the options.
  - **Multi-Question Pagination**: Page through multiple structured questions.
  - **Skip Action**: Click **Skip All** (`跳过全部`) to bypass the prompt and allow the agent to make default assumptions.
- **Durable Execution**: Submitting the answer seamlessly resumes the active server run without resetting conversation history.

#### 3. Generated Artifacts & File Preview (`ArtifactFileList`)

When an agent or sandbox code execution generates output files (spreadsheets, charts, reports, images, code snippets):
- **Artifact List**: Rendered cleanly at the bottom of the assistant message after generation completes (avoiding streaming layout shift).
- **Interactive Previews**:
  - **Images**: Click to open the full-screen `ImageLightbox` zoom and inspect view.
  - **Documents**: Built-in online preview for PDF, DOCX, XLSX/CSV, and Markdown files.
  - **Code & Diagrams**: Visual code preview canvas and Mermaid chart renderer.
  - **Direct Download**: One-click download button for every generated asset.

#### 4. Source Citations (RAG)

When knowledge base retrieval is active:
- Sources are listed with document titles, chunk indexes, and similarity match percentages.
- Click any source badge to inspect the exact retrieved text segment in a popover.
### Response Quality

**High-quality responses include:**
- Direct answer to your question
- Relevant context and details
- Source citations (if using a knowledge base)
- Clear structure and formatting

**If response quality is poor:**
- Rephrase your question more clearly
- Provide more context
- Break complex questions into simpler parts
- Check if the agent has access to a relevant knowledge base

## Agent Capabilities

### Knowledge Base Access (RAG)

Agents retrieve information from connected knowledge bases according to their RAG mode:

- **off**: No retrieval, even if knowledge bases are configured
- **auto**: Automatically retrieve on every message (traditional RAG)
- **agentic**: The agent decides when to search (default)

With retrieval enabled, the agent's responses can include the retrieved source chunks.

**Tips for better RAG results:**
- Ask specific questions
- Mention document names if known
- Request sources explicitly: "What does the manual say about..."
- Follow up for clarification

### Tool Usage

Agents can use tools to perform actions:

**Web Search:**
```
You: What's the weather in San Francisco?

Agent: 🔧 Searching weather data...
The current weather in San Francisco is 65°F (18°C),
partly cloudy with light winds.
```

**Calculator:**
```
You: What's 15% of $250?

Agent: 🔧 Calculating...
15% of $250 is $37.50
```

### Multi-Turn Conversations

Agents maintain context across messages:

```
You: What is Clouisle?
Agent: Clouisle is an AI platform...

You: How do I install it?
Agent: To install Clouisle, follow these steps...
     [Agent remembers we're talking about Clouisle]
```

Long conversations are automatically compressed to fit the model's context window.

## Advanced Features & Multi-Version Branching

### Message Regeneration & Version Navigation

If you want a different answer from the agent:

1. Hover over the assistant's response.
2. Click the **🔄 Regenerate** button on the message action toolbar.
3. The agent streams a new response while preserving the previous output as a historical version.
4. Use the version paginator (`‹ 1/2 ›`) below the message to toggle between versions.

### Message Editing & Conversation Branching

You can edit any user message previously sent:

1. Hover over your message and click the **✏️ Edit** button.
2. Modify the text in the inline editor.
3. Click **Resend** or press **Enter**.
4. The conversation branches from that point onward, creating a new revision timeline while retaining earlier conversation branches.

### Copy & Speed Metrics

Each message action bar provides:
- **📋 Copy Message**: Copies the raw Markdown text to your clipboard.
- **Message Performance Stats**: Shows total generation latency, time-to-first-token, and tokens per second (t/s) (can be toggled off via agent settings).

> **Note:** Conversation sharing and export are **not implemented**.
## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Prompts

**✅ Do:**
```
Good: "What are the steps to reset my password in the
admin dashboard?"

Good: "Summarize the key points from the Q3 report
about revenue growth"

Good: "Compare the features of Plan A and Plan B in
a table format"
```

**❌ Don't:**
```
Bad: "password?"
Bad: "tell me everything"
Bad: "help"
```

**Tips:**
- Be specific about what you want
- Specify format if needed (table, list, summary)
- Provide relevant context
- Ask one thing at a time for complex topics

### Managing Context

**Start a new conversation when:**
- Switching to an unrelated topic
- The agent seems confused about context
- You want a fresh start

**Continue a conversation when:**
- Asking follow-up questions
- Building on previous answers
- Maintaining context is important

### Using Knowledge Bases Effectively

**✅ Do:**
- Ask specific questions about documents
- Request sources: "According to the manual..."
- Mention document names if known
- Follow up for clarification

**❌ Don't:**
- Ask about information not in the knowledge base
- Expect the agent to know real-time information
- Assume all documents are indexed

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Responding

**Problem**: No response after sending a message

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Refresh the page
3. Check if the agent is published
4. Try a different agent
5. Contact the administrator

### Slow Responses

**Problem**: Agent takes a long time to respond

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet speed
2. Simplify your question
3. Try during off-peak hours
4. Contact the administrator about server load

### Irrelevant Responses

**Problem**: Agent gives unrelated answers

**Solutions:**
1. Rephrase your question more clearly
2. Provide more context
3. Start a new conversation (clear context)
4. Check if the agent has a relevant knowledge base
5. Try a different agent specialized for your topic

### Sources Not Showing

**Problem**: No source citations in RAG mode

**Solutions:**
1. Verify the agent has a knowledge base connected
2. Check the agent's RAG mode is not "off"
3. Ask more specific questions
4. Verify documents are indexed (status: completed)

### File Upload Fails

**Problem**: Cannot upload files

**Solutions:**
1. Check file size (must be under 10 MB)
2. Verify the file format is supported
3. Check if the agent allows file uploads
4. Try a different file
5. Contact the administrator

See [File Uploads](./file-uploads.md) for detailed troubleshooting.
